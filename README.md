# ExcelCompare

The purpose of this project is to take two excel files that have the same primary key (this can be made up of multiple columns), join them together, and find the variances (if any) between columns identified by the user.

Work Flow:

Import two files
Add primary key columns from both excel files in the same order
Add columns the user wishes to compare in the same order
Specify how many columns make up the primary key
Save the variances in a new report
